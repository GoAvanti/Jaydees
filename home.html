   <p>Jaydees Grass Trees is located in Melbourne's South East/Bayside suburb of Edithvale. Jaydees is a family-run business with low overheads so therefore our prices are much lower than most retail outlets. We are a boutique nursery outlet which specialises exclusively in the sale of Grass Trees. These can be more commonly known as 'Black Boy' plants.</p>


We have a huge variety of both single and multi-headed plants ranging in size from small to approx 2 metres in height. We stock primarily Xanthorrhoea Johnsonii and Xanthorrhoea Glauca and some other species when available.

With hundreds of plants to choose from, we are a 'One-Stop-Shop' and you are sure to find a Grass Tree to suit your needs and budget.

<p>Call JACK and BRENDA on (03) 9512 0507 or via 0405 557 358 to enquire about your next favourite plant! </p>
